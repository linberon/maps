		name: "Andean Bear",
		lat: -18.67,
		lng: -66.54,
		status: "Vulnerable",
		description: "The Andean bear is the only South American bear species. The other common name is Spectacled bear, thanks to their distinctive markings on the face, neck and chest. These elusive bears are native to the Andes mountain region, living in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from cloud forests to shrublands. They are omnivorous, although they mainly feed on fruits and different plants. Andean bears are known as the best climbers of all the bear species.",
		threats: "Habitat loss, illegal killing, and climate change. Bear parts are sold to be used in traditional oriental medicine.",

		name: "Hawaiian Crow",
		lat: 19.57,
		lng: -155.61,
		status: "Extinct in the Wild",
		description: "The Hawaiian Crow is the most endangered corvid species in the world. The last two known wild individuals disappeared in 2002. Once one of the largest native bird populations in Hawaii, their role in the ecosystem is exceptional. Many native plants rely on them for seed dispersal and germination, as seeds are passed through the crow's digestive system. Without their main seed disperser, these plants could become a rarity in Hawaii's ecosystems. The Hawaiian Crow is omnivorous, but primarily feeds on fruits. They are known for resourcefulness, captive birds have been observed using twigs as tools to access food. <br><br>In attempt to save the species, captive breeding and reintroduction efforts have been made. A majority of these efforts have proved to be unsuccessful.",
		threats: "Extensive habitat alteration, persecution by farmers, predation by introduced species, diseases carried by introduced species, inbreeding.",

		name: "Blue Poison Dart Frog",

		status: "Least Concern",
		description: "Also known as Dyeing Poison Frog, this brilliantly coloured amphibian makes a popular exotic pet, and is found in zoos all over the world. They are easily kept and bred in captivity, however wild populations are extremely vulnerable, as they are exposed to illegal collection and environmental factors. The frog's bright colour is a warning to predators. Their skin secretes a very potent toxin, that comes from the insects they eat. In captivity their diet don't contain the same compounds, therefore they cannot produce poison. Only captive-bred frogs should be kept as pets, to protect wild populations.",
		threats: "Illegal pet trade, habitat loss.",

		lat: 35.67,

		status: "Critically Endangered",
		description: "The wild population of Red Wolf is a result of reintroduction projects. The species were extinct in the wild in 1980, and were reintroduced years later in North Carolina. The area was selected because of the absence of Coyotes, as Red Wolf x Coyote hybridization is one of the main issues that led this species to demise. Scientific research started only when numbers were already low, so it is only assumed that their favoured natural habitat types were wetlands and swamps, remote from human activity, although they can thrive in a variety of settings. Captive breeding and reintroduction programmes are still ongoing. Currently there are more wolves known to be living in captivity than in the wild.",
		threats: "Hybridization with coyotes, human induced deaths. Hybrids are sterilized to protect genetic integrity of the species.",
