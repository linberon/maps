These elusive bears are native to the Andes mountain region, living in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from cloud forests to shrublands. They are omnivorous, although they mainly feed on fruits and different plants. Andean bears are known as the best climbers of all the bear species.",

		description: "Also known as Dyeing Poison Frog, this brilliantly coloured amphibian makes a popular exotic pet, and is found in zoos all over the world. They are easily kept and bred in captivity, however wild populations are extremely vulnerable, as they are exposed to illegal collection and environmental factors. The frog's bright colour is a warning to predators. Their skin secretes a very potent toxin, that comes from the insects they eat. In captivity their diet don't contain the same compounds, therefore they cannot produce poison. Only captive-bred frogs should be kept as pets, to protect wild populations.",
